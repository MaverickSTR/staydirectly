It appears somebody puked in the water in one as there were chunks of food and the water was filthy and that one had to be drained, sanitized and refilled today. Only reason I bring it up is because we just serviced them right before your stay so they were brand new fresh start. We are pretty good about letting things slide as cost of doing business but in this case we will need to recoup what the cleaners will charge me for that. Hope thatâ€™s alright and you can pass that expense on to whoever owns up. Didnâ€™t want to blast them in the group chat. It will be $100, what they charge me. Hope you can understand. Thank you!",
